# policy-aware-voice-ai-customer-support
Demonstrates a real-time voice agent that answers a basic support inquiry (case status) and conditionally allows escalation based on explicit decision rules. The goal is to show how voice interaction, AI reasoning, and policy-based decisioning can be cleanly separated in a minimal, easy-to-understand setup.
